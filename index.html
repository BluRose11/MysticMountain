<br><h3>Chapter 1: The Diaries of [UNKNOWN] (Around 17 billion years ago)</h3>
<p id="unknown">Day 1: <br> Dear Diary, since my journeys across the lands, I have had time to rethink my decisions. Perhaps, dying during battle wasn't so bad. 
It would bring me more honor than to flee. But no matter now, if I'd made any other decision, I would have bargained my life. I remember the olden days, where 
the Empress was a kind Dragoness. Well, those days are long gone. <br> Love, [UNKNOWN]</p>

<br>

<p id="unknown">Day 2: <br> Diary, my wounds are now even more infected, which is an understatement. I feel as if maybe dying from battle will bring me better 
relief than this torture. For all I have done, this is how I'm going to die? Also, I found a peacefu place to rest today. It is a cave, hidden within a tangle of vines. 
It took me some time to get in there, but now here I am. If this is my final resting place, I wouldn't be disapointed. <br> I give you my best, [UNKNOWN]</p>

<br>

<p id="unknown">Day 3: <br> I am amazed. Absoluetly amazed. Knox would love this. So would..... Rosemarie. *heart shaped drawing here.*</p>

<br>

<p id="unknown">Day 4: <br> Dearest Diary, prepare to be AMAZED. Inside, tucked in the very corner of the cave I found a couple days ago, was an entrance, to a wonderland. 
    I wish Knox and Rosemarie were here to see it, well, no use dreaming about immpossible feats. I should fix this place up, maybe build a home for myself. That 
    probably won't happen for a while, hence my wounds. But they will heal eventually. The lush greens in this place is unbelievable. Though they seem to be extremely neat
     and orderly compared to what should have been a wasteland, with nobody caring for it. Well I better get to building a fire, the sun's about to go down. 
    <br> Sincerly, [UNKNOWN]</p>

<br>

<p id="unknown">Day 15: <br> I finished gathering materials for my new shelter, wow, I haven't written in this for a while! The gathering was grueling work, with my wounded
     leg. Though I think they'll completely heal in no time! <br> Thanks, [UNKNOWN]</p>

<br>

<p id="unknown">Day 32: <br> 3 moons have already passed. My wounds are not healing... They got exceptionally bad in the past week. I regret not writing very often, 
for I was exploring the mountains. *smudged blood* I have not found a reason for my wounds not improving, much less it worsening. Maybe the enemies were smart enough
 to coat their weapons with poison. If that is the case, I worry that I might die soon. <br> Love, [UNKNOWN]</p>

 <br>

<p id="unknown">Death. (It was a very peaceful death, mind you. He died in his sleep.)</p>

<br>
<p>That was the death of [UNKNOWN], as according to his diary. Then, some time later...</p>
<br>
<p>Ok, hey guys. This is Athelia, and I am going to be retelling the rather curious life of a dragonet, Flame. You might be extremely suspicious, and wonder, 
    "how does she know what happened 6 billion years ago?". Well, I have my sources. so, lets get started. </p>
<h3>Chapter 2: The Curious Life of Flame, a retelling by Athelia. (6 billion years ago.)</h3>
<p id="dude">It was a rather sunny morning, and Flame, was exploring down by the stream, about 20 meters from the hidden entrance to MM(Mystic Mountains). Flame,
     as you may or may not know, was an extremely fun-loving and curious dragonet. He had wandered away from his village, off to explore on his own. After a couple of 
     hours, he became tired and sat down and leaned on a sturdy wall of moss and vines. BAM! He fell right through the greenery! Flame was giddy with excitement! He, 
     an explorer had found a whole new world! He then spotted a glimmer of light at the end of the cave... he went to investigate and discovered, again, the MYstic
      Mountains. These are a few of the entries he wrote on a scrap of paper left behind by [UNKNOWN]:

    <b>(The spelling errors are intentional.)</b><br>

<h2>WIP(Work In Progress), the scroll will update itself soon. :D :) ;) ;D :P</h2>

<p><b>hey this is a rough draft I'm going upon, so ignore this: </b>[b]Chapter 2:[/b] A long time passed, it was now around 750 years before present day, a curious dragonet stumbles on the cave entrance. He climbed the vines, playing 
    on the long ropes when he spotted a glimmer of light at the deep end of the cave. He, as any curious dragonet would, went to investigate. It was the secret entrance 
    to the Mystic Mountains, but he at the time, couldn't have known that. His name was (censored by myusername because she wants to). This dragonet decided to stay in
     the beautiful, yet secretive place that he found, and kept it a secret from everyone. When he died (people believe he was killed), he left an incredibly valuable 
     artifact somewhere deep inside the expanse of Mystic Mountains. Many believe this artifact, was in fact, an egg. 
    
    
    [b]Chapter 3:[/b] Some time later, BluRose11, AKA Athelia was born, in the same kingdom as (unknown). As you know her story from the Oracle, she and her brothers and sisters
     stumbles upon the cave entrance, once again, in the time of war. Athelia's siblings were captured, then eventually killed by the Empress. Athelia, a dragonet as curious as the 
     one before, also found the secret entrance to Mystic Mountains, and decided to settle there. But Unlike the dragonet before her, Athelia wanted needy dragons to join her. 
     After just 1 year, a dragon, Feargus, found the cave. Athelia welcomed him, (kinda) and they lived separately, never meeting unless accidently. 400 years had passed, when Athelia 
     decided to build a sanctuary for future dragons who stumbles upon Mystic Mountains. 
    
    
    [b]Chapter 4:[/b] Now, Athelia was well over 500 years old. She had even almost stopped counting... Finally, a new Dragonet arrived, and more and more dragonets found this 
    place as mystic mountains grew. Today, It is still a mysterious and majestic place, but on the inside, it is lively and bright. This is the history of The Mystic Mountains.</p>
